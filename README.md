# Navigation Genetic Algorithm
This is one of my favorite personal projects. Essentially it uses a genetic algorithm to learn
a path in an environment between two points by controlling agents. You can place blocks around
the enviornment that the agents will collide with, and over time, the agents will learn to hit
the target.

# Future Work
The way this is programmed is pretty bad... the animation and simulation are tightly coupled. 
For a future project, I know that it is better to handle the simulation and animation
differently, rather than have the training depend on the simulation.
